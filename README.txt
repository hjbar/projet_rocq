=== Build the project ===

Use the command `make` inside the `src` directory.


=== Discussion about the project ===

I advised Yoshimi-Théophile Etienne to use Lemma 2.1.e to shorten the proof of Lemma 2.2.f.
Gabriel Desfrene gave me the intuition on how to handle the contradiction by case analysis on A for the second part of the proof of Lemma 6 in Exercise 3.
Yoshimi-Théophile Etienne gave me the intuition for the method on how to correctly apply double induction on strong normalization for Lemma 9 in Exercise 4.4.
I gave Yoshimi-Théophile Etienne the intuition on how to prove Lemma 2.1.i.
I advised Yoshimi-Théophile Etienne to start by doing an induction before splitting the goals to prove Lemma 2.3.b.


=== My previous experience with Rocq / proof assistants ===

Before this course, I had used a proof assistant once.
It was Agda, for the M1 MRPI course Computational Logic taught by Samuel Mimram at École Polytechnique.
So, this course is my first experience with Rocq.


=== Unsolved exercises ===

I did not do exercise 5.
